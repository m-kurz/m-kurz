### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ  Iâ€™ve always been driven by a blend of scientific curiosity and technical challenges.
I thrive on the synergy between science and number crunchingâ€”-whether it's optimizing algorithms for HPC systems, implementing cutting-edge numerical methods or using machine learning to rethink traditional simulations.

ðŸ”­  In recent years, I've applied HPC to enable large-scale CFD simulations of turbulent flows and explored how machine learning can be used to develop smarter, data-driven turbulence models for large eddy simulation.

ðŸš€  Along the way, Iâ€™ve contributed to several open-source projects both inside and outside these fields, which you can check out on my profile.

ðŸ’¬  If you're into CFD, HPC, or the fusion of machine learning and simulation, feel free to reach out!
